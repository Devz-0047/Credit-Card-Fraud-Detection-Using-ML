# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-ML
This is a credit card fraud detection machine learning model that utilizes a logistic regression algorithm to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

Key Information:

Training Set Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the training dataset is reported as 94.91%. This indicates how well the model fits the training data, but it's important to consider other metrics as well.

Test Set Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the test dataset is reported as 92.89%. This measures the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additional Details:

Dataset: The credit card transaction data used for training and testing the model link is 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud'.
Important Considerations:

Imbalanced Data: Credit card fraud detection datasets are typically highly imbalanced, with a large number of legitimate transactions and only a small fraction of fraudulent ones. In such cases, accuracy alone may not be the best metric for evaluating model performance. Other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are often more informative.

Model Evaluation: While accuracy is a useful metric, it's crucial to evaluate the model's performance using various other metrics, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Consider providing information on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to offer a more comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness.

Feature Engineering: Describe any feature engineering or data preprocessing steps that were performed before training the model. Feature engineering can significantly impact model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Mention if hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance. This can include tuning parameters like regularization strength and solver options.

Cross-Validation: Indicate whether cross-validation was used during model training to assess its robustness and generalization ability.

Including these additional details in your documentation will provide a clearer picture of the model's performance and the steps taken to achieve the reported accuracy. It will also help users understand the model's limitations and how well it addresses the specific challenges of credit card fraud detection
